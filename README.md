# THAT pool

Billiards in vrchat udon, with nice two-handed cues and reasonable physics
sync. The billiards physics themselves will be limited to what Unity's PhysX
can handle, but should be fun enough though certainly not sim quality.

## Running locally

Should run in unity 2018.4, but you'll need to add the VRCSDK3 package
yourself, as well as [UdonSharp](https://github.com/Merlin-san/UdonSharp).
